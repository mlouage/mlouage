Hi there! 👋

Hey, I'm Maarten! I'm a software architect and developer who loves coming up with cool solutions. 💻

## About Me 🚀
I specialize in C# development with deep expertise in .NET technologies and the cloud ☁️ bringing robust and scalable software solutions to life. Next to C# I also dabble quite a lot in Go. Next to my strong backend skills, I also love exploring the frontend landscape, particularly with modern frameworks like Astro, Next.js and React.

## My Playground 🛠️
Backend
- Azure cloud ☁️
- C# & .NET
- Go
- Software and solution architecture, cloud-native
- API design and development
- Unit Testing

Frontend
- React
- Next.js
- Astro
- TailwindCSS

## My Development Philosophy 🧭
I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that solves real-world problems. Whether I'm architecting complex backend systems or crafting interactive frontend experiences, my goal is always to create solutions that are both technically elegant and user-friendly.
